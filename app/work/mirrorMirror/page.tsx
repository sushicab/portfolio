        <em>mirror mirror</em> is a photography project that I continued doing
        from 2016 to 2022. This project documents the adolescent experiences of
        my friends -- those tender time between 18 and 24 -- through the
        photographs of them, and their warmness, softness, and the spectrum of
        emotions they lived through.

        <br />
        Adolescence has always fascinated me. It is a time of turbulence,
        confusion, pain, and fervent affection, where we begin questioning our
        identities more than ever. It is also the transition from youth to
        adulthood—a period marked by inevitable mistakes and learning the harsh
        realities of the world in ways we never imagined. The faces in these
        photos are my dear friends, roommates, classmates, and, at times,
        strangers whose paths briefly crossed with mine. Through capturing their
        existence and emotional landscapes, I found pieces of myself reflected
        in their eyes.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I revisit this project, I feel deeply moved. It reminds me of how
        much my friends and I have grown, of the resilience we carried as we
        navigated those uncertain years. I am proud that we made it
        through—these images stand as a warm record of our experiences, our
        growth, and the fleeting beauty of that shared chapter of life.
