        textContent={` This project explores the fluid relationship between brand identity and environmental context by transforming real-time ecological factors—such as temperature, wind speed, visibility, cloud cover, and humidity—into an evolving identity. <br/><br/>

The design is rooted in the idea that identity—whether human or brand—is ever-changing and continuously shaped by its surroundings. Just as we are constantly influenced by the people and experiences around us, a brand's identity evolves in response to external factors. This dynamic interplay between our inner nature and the environment reflects the fluid and adaptive character that defines both individuals and brands. `}
