        textContent={`During the early rise of <em>Midjourney</ em>, as it gained popularity in the creative world, debates emerged about AI’s potential to replace human creativity. While many viewed AI as a threat to artistic expression, I found it difficult to align with that perspective.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        This tension inspired me to explore how  AI could enhance, rather than diminish, creativity. Using <em>Midjourney</ em>, I envisioned an indoor world where nature and humanity peacefully coexist. I expanded this concept in Blender, adding imaginative elements—moss, tiny creatures, and other micro-level details—to a larger macro-scale environment. This attention to both the intimate and expansive aspects enriched the scene, bringing it to life.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        My goal was to explore how AI can be integrated into the creative process, finding ways to collaborate with it to reach our full potential while ensuring that human creativity remains central.

I believe AI, too, can serve as a mirror to better understand ourselves and our creativity, allowing us to embrace it as a collaborator rather than an adversary."
