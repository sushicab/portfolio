The centerpiece was a 35km hand-woven bamboo screen that responded to the heartbeat of nearby visitors, embodying the Japanese concept of "A-Un no Kokyu"â€”a state of silent, synchronized harmony. </ br></ br> The installation went on to win <em>2nd place in the Audience Award</ em> and received the Design Schools Special Mention, standing out among over 1,000 exhibitors.`}
