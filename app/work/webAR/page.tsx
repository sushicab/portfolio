        textContent={` Blurring the line between the tangible and the ephemeral, “How to Be a Cloud” blends live-action footage, CG and animation into a meditative journey through augmented space. Through your smartphone, endless soft, floating clouds appear in the real world—quiet, weightless, and just out of reach. Tap the screen, and paper planes take flight, drifting gently around the cloud.
        </br></br>
       This experience invites you to float between sky and ground, presence and imagination—where the invisible becomes visible, and the everyday becomes poetic.

        </br></br>
        "How to be a cloud" was exhibited from Mar.13 to Mar.20 at Haneda Airport terminal1 as part of Tokyo Creative Salon 2025.`}

As we pass through the sky, our minds drift, reshaping and dissolving into something new, like vapor caught in the wind. We invite you to float with the clouds, weightless and untethered. With a tap, paper planes take flight—carrying thoughts, dreams, and fleeting moments, merging with the ever-changing sky."
