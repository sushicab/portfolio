          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Technology is a product of humanity, reflecting the collective views
          of society. Under this premise, what kind of ' body shell' should we
          embody? How does the majority of datasets perceive our biological
          appearance? Confronted with the reflection of societal expectations,
          which ' gender shell' would our biological sex be associated with?
          <br />
          <br />
          This project explores these questions by classifying participants'
          gender through an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The system
          analyzes the participant’s image and displays it alongside a mosaic of
          faces it identifies as similar. Without relying on human-created
          labels, the machine autonomously groups faces, offering a reflection
          of how it interprets patterns in biological appearance and societal
          expectations.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            <em>[ DESIGN PROCESS ]</em>
          </strong>
          <br />
          We gathered responses from 61 participants about the first
          descriptions that came to mind when they saw the words <em>
            “Male”
          </em>{" "}
          and
          <em>“Female”.</em> To minimize bias, we used a questionnaire for data
          collection.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            <em>[ DESIGN IDEA ]</em>
          </strong>
          <br />
          In this setup, when the camera detects a participant' s face, the
          answers are displayed as text in a Windows 2007-style interface.
          Random facial expressions trigger varying on-screen responses. The
          semi-transparent glitch texture in the background blurs the line
          between reality and the virtual. Inspired by facial recognition system
          and the theory of Gender Performativity by Judith Butler, the mosaic
          mask design transitions from blurry to clear as faces are detected, as
          is neither essential nor biologically determined, but rather it is
          created by its own performance ’.

        <p className="AR-text">
          In today’s digital age, social media platforms serve as vibrant spaces
          for self-expression and creativity. Augmented Reality (AR) filters, in
          particular, have emerged as a captivating medium, enabling users to
          transform their photos and videos with interactive and playful
          effects.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          This experimental project explores the concept of expanded cyber
          identity through a series of AR filters, all of which were designed
          and developed by me.
          <br />

            <em> One More Robot </em>
          </strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Inspired by <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, I became fascinated with the
          concept of cybernetics and the interplay between identity and
          technology. Driven by a desire to explore this realm, I developed an
          augmented reality effect that visually splits the face, reflecting the
          fragmentation and redefinition of self in a digital age.

          The experience opens with poignant screen text, featuring quotes from
          one of my favorite sci-fi films,<em> 2001: A Space Odyssey</em>,
          beginning with the iconic lines:
          <br />
          <br />
          "Good afternoon, gentlemen.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am a HAL 9000 computer.
          <br />
          <br />
          I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the
          12th of January 1992."
          <br />
          <br />
          The face covering was designed with a transparent, half-concealed
          metal mask illuminated by two reflective lights. A black stone near
          the ear pays homage to the monolith in <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>,
          symbolizing enlightenment and humanity' s relentless pursuit of
          technological advancement and space exploration.
