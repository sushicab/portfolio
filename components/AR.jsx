          “Gender Shell” is an AR installation to visualize gender
          classification experience, as one of the three Reflective design and
          social experiment installations in the research project Labeliing: The
          Reflective Design of Socialized Gender Classification.

          Installation 1: "Gender Shell`
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Technology comes from humanity, what it build is a reflection of
          majority view. In this premise, what "body shell" (should) we be? What
          will majority of databases thinks about our biological appearance?
          Facing the reflection of social expectation, Which "gender shell"
          would our biological sex be linked to? Based on the concept of this
          work above, participant’s gender will be classified by an unsupervised
          machine learning algorithm, that shows the participant’s picture
          together with a mosaic of faces it thinks it’s similar. Showing how,
          without using human made labels of faces from a dataset, the machine
          would divide these faces into groups.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          We collected 61 participants’ answers about what is the first
          description pop up in their minds when they saw the words ‘Male’ and
          ‘Female’. We used a questionnaire to collect answers to try to avoid
          bias.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          In this setup, answers appear as text in a Windows 2007 style when the
          camera detects the participant's face. Random facial expressions
          trigger different responses on-screen. The background features a
          semi-transparent glitch texture, blurring the line between reality and
          virtual. The mosaic mask design, inspired by face recognition,
          transitions from blurry to clear as faces are detected, symbolizing
          equality amidst gender classification.

          In today's digital age, social media platforms have become vibrant
          hubs for self-expression and creativity. One of the most engaging
          forms of expression on these platforms is the use of augmented reality
          (AR) filters, which allow users to transform their photos and videos
          with interactive and playful effects.

          Influenced by "Ghost in the Shell," I found myself drawn to the idea
          of exploring the world of cybernetics. With a longing to understand
          this realm, I experimented with creating an augmented reality effect
          that splits the face.

          Featuring poignant screen text quotes from one of my favorite sci-fi
          movies, "2001: A Space Odyssey," the experience begins with the iconic
          words:
          <br />
          <br />
          "Good afternoon, gentlemen.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am a HAL 9000 computer.
          <br />
          <br />
          I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the
          12th of January 1992."

          Face cover was selected to use transparent half concealed metal mask
          with two lights reflecting on. Black stone around ear was paying
          tribute  to monolith in the movie<em>2001; A  Space Odyssey</em>, as
          the enlightenment to encourage humankind pursue the technological
          development and space travel.
