          Installation 1: &ldquo;Gender Shell&rdquo;
          <br />

          <br />
          Technology originates from humanity, and what it builds reflects the
          majority's perspective. Under this premise, what <em>
            body shell
          </em>{" "}
          should we embody? How does the majority of databases perceive our
          biological appearance? When confronted with the reflection of societal
          expectations, which <em>gender shell</em> would our biological sex be
          associated with? This work explores these questions by classifying
          participants' gender using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.
          The system displays the participant’s image alongside a mosaic of
          faces it deems similar, revealing how, without relying on
          human-labeled datasets, the machine organizes faces into groups. This
          challenges us to reflect on how technology interprets and reinforces
          social perceptions of identity.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            <em>[DESIGN PROCESS]</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          <br />
          We gathered responses from 61 participants about the first
          descriptions that came to mind when they saw the words <em>
            Male
          </em>{" "}
          and
          <em> Female</em>. To minimize bias, we used a questionnaire for data
          collection.
          <br />

          <br />
          <strong>
            <em>[DESIGN IDEA]</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          <br />
          In this setup, when the camera detects a participant's face, the
          answers are displayed as text in a Windows 2007-style interface.
          Random facial expressions trigger varying on-screen responses. The
          semi-transparent glitch texture in the background blurs the line
          between reality and the virtual. Inspired by facial recognition system
          and the theory of <em>Gender Performativity</em> by Judith Butler, the
          mosaic mask design transitions from blurry to clear as faces are
          detected, as is neither essential nor biologically determined, but
          rather it is created by its own performance ’.

          In today’s digital age, social media platforms have become key spaces
          for self-expression and creativity. Among the most captivating forms
          of expression are augmented reality (AR) filters, which allow users to
          transform their photos and videos with interactive, playful effects. I
          wanted to use this emerging medium to explore the intersection of
          humanity and machines, and how this dynamic shapes our perception of
          identity and reality.

          Influenced by <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, I was drawn to the concept
          of <em>cybernetics</em> and the blurred boundaries between human and
          technology. Driven by a desire to explore this concept, I created this
          augmented reality effect that visually splits the face, reflecting
          themes of identity and transformation in the digital age.

          The face cover features a transparent, half-concealed metal mask with
          dual light reflections. The black stone near the ear pays homage to
          the monolith in <em>2001: A Space Odyssey—a symbol</em> of
          enlightenment that inspires humankind to pursue technological
          advancement and space exploration.
