          <br></br>Three transparent, blooming flowers form a wearable shoulder
          accessory equipped with a webcam that detects and categorizes
          onlookers' facial expressions. Each flower contains an LED unit that
          changes color to better express the wearer’s emotions. The design' s
          outlook was inspired by the skeleton flower, a unique blossom with
          transparent petals that turn white when raindrops fall on it. Through
          this design, I aim to highlight how interaction creates change, just
          as we live within a delicate web of connections, constantly shaped and
          reshaped by our interactions with one another.

          and improve performance dynamics.

          <br></br>The prototype consists of three main components: flowers, a

          body. Each flower features five 3D-printed petals, made from soft
          Elastic 50A resin. This material was chosen for its flexibility,
          enabling smooth bending motions, and its transparency, aligning with
          the design' s aesthetic vision.

            <em>[ USER STUDY 1: ELICITATION SURVEY ]</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          <br></br>
          <br></br>The study involved 50 participants and assessed personality
          traits using the I-E scale (27 average, 15 introverted, 8
          extroverted). Most participants (69%) responded positively to wearing
          the device, with one highlighting its potential for mood tracking.
          Concerns about size and convenience were noted, but social acceptance
          was promising, with 62% willing to wear it at home and 47% among
          friends.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Extroverts showed a greater willingness to wear the <em>
            Emolleia
          </em>{" "}
          device compared to introverts and participants with average
          personality traits. The primary use cases involved self-expression
          (mood, emotions) and notifications (weather, reminders). Most feedback
          focused on using <em>Emolleia</em> for emotional communication and
          social interaction, such as monitoring family members’ well-being.

          <br></br>
          <br></br>This study evaluated Emolleia' s potential to improve
          conversational efficiency and encourage self-expression. A facial
          tracking camera was used to recognize seven facial expressions (e.g.,
          happy, sad, surprise) and trigger Emolleia' s motion in three ways:
          correlated, contrary, or reflecting the onlooker' s expression. Due to
          limitations from a prior study, only five emotions (happy, sad,
          surprise, neutral, and disgust) were selected and linked to
          corresponding motions (a, g, c, d). The device' s color scheme was
          inspired by Robert Plutchik' s Emotional Wheel, visually representing
          emotions.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Six new participants (4 female, aged 21-28) was recruited. Most of
          Participants were from Asia countries. In post-conversation
          interviews, participants praised Emolleia for encouraging emotional
          expression and enhancing conversational enjoyment. Some found the
          device helpful for recognizing others' emotions, while others felt
          more at ease during interactions. Overall, Emolleia was perceived as a
          valuable tool for fostering comfort and connection in social settings.
